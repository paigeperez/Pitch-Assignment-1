According to Shelter Animal Count database, the Relinquish by Owner and Stray (Intake) compared to the Adoption and Shelter Euthanasia (Live Outcome) of dogs and cats decreased from May 2019 to May 2020. Through graphs comparing dog and cat icons, I want to display the change and connect with the non-profit organization to get a sense of why it had occurred in 2020. I previously thought that more people adopted animals in 2020 but that is not the case according to shelter data.
